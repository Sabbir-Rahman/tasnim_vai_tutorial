There are 8 datatypes in js
1/Number: both floating point and integer.
Example: 
    let n = 123;
    let n = 123.12;
with this three special charecter infinity, negative infinity and nan
Thats why math operation in js is much safer than in c 

Nan represents undefined math operation error like 
let n = "hello"/2 but let n = "2"/2 is valid and ans=1 

2/BigInt: number range is -2^53 ~ 2^53 to decalre a BigInt 
  let n = 123n;

3/String  
To format string 
Example: let name = "Sabbir"
alert('My name is ${name}');

4/Boolean 
Example: let isChecked = true;

5/null
if any data is assign to null it is null 
let x = null; 

6/Undefined
Example: let x;
alert(x) will output undefined
if varable is not assigned then it will be undefined

7/object 

8/Symbol

first 6 types are primitive because they only carry single value 
but other 2 types object and Symbol can carry multiple value in a single variable 
that's why it is non primitive

Double equals == only check value is equal or not 
Triple equal === check value and type also







One variable can use multiple datatypes

For example, 
let number = 123;
number = "Hello";

This is valid that's why js is called dynamic lanuage
